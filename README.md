# alpha_synuclein_transition

alpha_syn_LLPS.c is MD-MPCD code used to simulate the liquid-to-solid phase transition of alpha-synuclein.
The simulation consists of 500 beads. We start with 10 solid-like beads and remaining liquid-like beads placed on a cubic lattice with
solid-like beads at one of the corners. The solid-like beads can convert the nearby liquid-like beads into solid-like beads with some probability.

cluster.c can identify the clusters from the snapshot generated by alpha_syn_LLPS.c.

radial_density.c is used to analyze the radial density of solid-like and liquid-like beads from center of mass of the cluster identified by cluster.c.
